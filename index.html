            <h2>About Republic Day</h2>
            <p>Republic Day is a national holiday in India commemorating the adoption of the Constitution of India, and the country's transition to a republic which came into effect on 26 January 1950.</p>
            <p>The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the governing document of India, thus turning the nation from a dominion into a republic, following its independence from the British Raj in 1947. The constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950. This date was chosen because the Indian National Congress had proclaimed Purna Swaraj (complete independence) on that date in 1930.</p>
            <p>Republic Day is widely associated with parades, political speeches, cultural events and ceremonies, as well as various public and private celebrations of India's history, government, and traditions.</p>
